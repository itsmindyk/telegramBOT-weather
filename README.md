<center><h1>Singapore's Weatherman Bot</h1></center>
(badges here: pyTelegramBotAPI Flask, Python 3)
> A simple telegram bot created to tell the weather forecast in Singapore. At some point in time, we get frustrated with NEA's way of telling the weather, right? So I tried taking matters into my own hands 🤓🛠️<br>

<i>⚠️ Live demo of the bot is intermittent as it is currently being hosted on the Render free plan - spins down upon inactivity until manually restarting it</i>

[Screenshot gif coming soon! 🪄]

## Features
- Current temperatures (can be refreshed every 5 minutes)
- 2-hour weather forecast - can be filtered by the island regions (Still a work in progress 🪄)
- 24-hour temperature ahead - with 3 6-hour weather forecast intervals
- 4-day weather temperature - tells the temperatures 4 days ahead

## Setup
Coming soon! 🪄
